# Contributing

This project adheres partly to the [Gitflow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#gitflow-workflow)

## Adding a new feature or bug fix

##### 1. Check out the latest `dev` branch

##### 2. Create a new feature branch
- Give a short but descriptive name relative to the feature you are working on
- Append the issue number relating to the feature/fix
- EG: `delete-user-#125`

##### 3. Implement the feature
- Use descriptive commit messages

##### 4. Open a new Pull Request into `dev`
- Your pull request will be reviewed by members of the team
- If you are requested to make changes, add more commits to your branch
- Once your PR has been approved, it will be merged by the maintainer
